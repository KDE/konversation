Changes since 1.1:
* Enabled the (experimental, hackish) Amarok 2 support in the 'media' script.
* Fixed a bug that could cause channel notifications to be lost across recon-
  nects.
* Removed the code to recreate hidden-to-tray state across application re-
  starts. It was broken after the shutdown procedures were moved to a point
  in time after after the main window is hidden to cover quit-by-DCOP, and
  Konversation 1.1 features an explicit hidden startup option that fulfills
  user demands more accurately anyhow. This fixes a bug that made Konversa-
  tion always hide to tray on startup regardless of the aforementioned op-
  tion when the system tray icon was enabled.
* Added a network settings lookup fallback to retrieving the key of a channel.
  Previously, this relied solely on the channel's mode map. Closes the brief
  gap between a channel join and the server's reply to MODE where possible,
  so that e.g. reconnecting directly after auto-joining a channel with a key
  doesn't result in a failed rejoin due to not having the key by way of the
  MODE reply yet.
* Fixed opening URLs from the channel topic context menu in Channel List tabs.
* When connecting to multiple selected unexpanded network items from the Ser-
  ver List, don't also try to connect to the hidden server sub-items selected
  by implication, avoiding unwanted connection duplicates.
* Mask the password field in the Quick Connect dialog.
* Fixed a bug causing passive DCC file transfers to stall at 99%.
* Fixed "/leave" command in queries.


Changes from 1.0.1 to 1.1:
We are extremely pleased to announce Konversation's newest major release, v1.1.
Konversation 1.1 is a special release for us in multiple ways: It's our farewell
to KDE 3, by way of being the last major release built upon that venerable
platform. It's also our biggest release yet, in terms of the number and
magnitude of the changes.

The additions and improvements in this release are both user-visible and under
the hood. Some of the highlights are rewritten connection handling (robustness
and correctness improvements, better support for IRC URLs, bookmarking and
more), redone DCC with better UI and Passive/Reverse DCC support, a redone away
system with the addition of auto-away support, redone and much more useful
remember / marker line support, a new outbound traffic scheduler that is capable
of aggressive throttling to avoid flooding while smartly reordering messages to
improve latencies, great convenience additions like a "Next Active Tab" shortcut,
and much, much more, along with a large number of bugfixes and tweaks to round
things out. Note: All fixes made since RC1 are marked with a "[New since RC1]"
label in the changelog.

We're confident that this release is the best and most robust version of
Konversation published so far, and upgrading comes highly recommended to all
users. Enjoy!

  numbers were given.
* Fixed a bug that could cause the text selection in a chat window to be messed

Marker/Remember Lines
* Konversation now distinguishes between manually and automatically inserted
  marker lines, making the "show line in all chat windows" preference less
  confusing.
* The automatically inserted remember lines when chat windows are hidden are now
  "sliding", i.e. there is only one per chat window, and it moves.
* Automatically inserted remember lines will now optionally only be inserted
  when there's actually new text being appended to the chat window (enabled by
  default).

* Improved marker lines-related preferences and terminology.
* Improved the appearance of marker lines in the chat window.
* Made the (marker line-related and other) identity default settings consistent
  between the initial identity and additional newly created identities.
* Fixed hidden join/part/quit events marking tabs as dirty, allowing multiple
  consecutive remember lines to appear.
* Fixed crash when minimizing or closing the application window prior to any tab
  switch when the auto-insertion of remember lines is enabled.

Input line
* Fixed input line contents rather than actual sent text being appended to the
  input history upon a multi-line paste edit.
* Special characters and IRC color codes will now be inserted at the cursor
  position rather than the end of the input line contents.

Nickname list
* Implemented an additional "Sort by activity" nicklist sorting mode.
* Added Oxygen nicklist icon theme by Nuno Pinheiro.
* The list of nickname list themes is now sorted alphabetically.
* Fixed race condition when removing a nicklist theme (listview would be
  repopulated before deletion was complete).
* Fixed using the wrong palette for the disabled text color in the nickname
  list.
* Fixed moving back from the custom alternate background color to system colors
  in the channel nickname listviews when disabling the "Use custom colors for

* Added option to add and remove a channel from its network's auto-join list
  from the tab context menu.
* Added option to close tabs using middle-mouse.
* Slightly sped up tab switching by eliminating some redundant UI action state
  updates.
* Channel tabs will no longer close when kicked, but rather grey out on the tab
  bar and offer context menu actions to rejoin.
* Channel and query tabs will now grey out on the tab bar when disconnected and
  no higher priority notification is present. Channel tabs will only ungrey if
  and when the channel is successfully rejoined after reconnect; query tabs
  ungrey immediately once reconnected.

  and focus adjustment thereafter as well as generally after switching to
  Konsole tabs by other means.

  child item of another server status item when dragging it below an special
  application pane item such as DCC Status or Watched Nicks Online.
* [New since RC1] Fixed a crash when using the mouse wheel on the list within
  ~150ms of a drag and drop operation.

System Tray icon
* Remember and recreate minimized-to-tray state across sessions.
* Added option for hidden-to-tray startup.
* Reload tray icons when the icon theme changes at runtime.
* Added option to not blink the systray icon, but just light it up.

Channel Settings Dialog
* Added a search line to the ban list.
* Fixed sorting the ban list by time set.
* Made the ban list's "Time Set" column use KDE locale settings for the date
  format.

  open ban list in-line edits correctly.
* Reset topic editbox when the channel options dialog has been dismissed with
  cancel.

* Moved "Hide Nicklist" menu action from Edit to Settings.
* Fixed the "Automatically join channel on invite" setting not to show an
  inquiring dialog anyway.
* Fixed saving the state of the invitation dialog option in the Warning Dialogs
  preferences.
* Added a warning dialog for quitting with active DCC file transfers.
* Return focus to the text display widget after closing the search bar in a log
  reader view.
* Made pressing Return or Enter in the Log File Viewer's size spinbox apply the
  setting, just as pressing the Return button.
* Fixed a bug where the SSL padlock icon would be shown on a non-SSL connection
  (and clicking would cause a crash).
* Empty topic labels will no longer show empty tooltips, but rather none at all.
* Added a sample 12-hour clock format string to the timestamp format combobox.
* Timestamp format list is no longer localized.
* Robustness improvements and less UI quirks around channel password handling.
* Improved general layout and consistency of tab, chat view, query and topic
  context menus. Added some missing icons.
* Fixed some bugs of UI actions not being appropriately as their context
  changes.
* Fixed enabled state of "Close All Open Queries" action not being updated
  correctly when queries are closed by way of closing a status view tab.
* The window caption is now properly being reset when the last tab is closed.
* Made units in spinboxen in the identity and app preferences UI more
  consistent.
* Minor fixes to accelerators and tabbing order in various dialogs.

Commands
* Support command aliases in network connect commands.
* Turned parameter-less '/away' into a toggle: Sets away state with default
  message initially, and unsets away state if already away.
* Added an '/aunaway' command to complement '/aaway' (previously, there was only
  '/aback').
* Added support for '/kill'.
* A '/join' command for an already-joined channel will now focus it.
* Added an '/encoding' command as an alias to '/charset'.
* '/charset' and '/encoding' now accept 'latin-1' as an alias for 'iso-8859-1'.
* Improved messages for the '/charset' and '/encoding' commands.
* Rewrote /me parsing to be less hackish and display usage info with an empty
  parameter.
* '/msg <nick>' is no longer treated as equivalent to '/query <nick>'.
* '/msg <nick>' will now error out when lacking a message parameter.
* '/query <recipient> [message]' will now error out when recipient is a channel.
* Added a '/queuetuner' command to bring up the outbound traffic scheduler's
  tuning/debug pane.

Notifications
* Seperated query messages and messages containing the user's nickname into two
  distinct KNotify events.
* Made the tab notification color of private messages configurable independently
  from normal messages.
* Don't highlight own nick on topic created by messages.
* Fixed disabling notifications for a tab not cancelling highlight sounds.
* Fixed a race condition where a highlight's autotext reply would outrun the
  original line's tab notification.
* Fixed actions in queries and DCC chats producing message notification events
  (rather than the correct private message ones).
* Changed the OSD screensaver check logic to work in KDE 4.
* [New since RC1] Fixed on screen display occassionally reverting to the default
  position when using the settings dialog to change unrelated settings.

Connection handling
* Improved behavior with regard to reusing existing connections in connection
  attempts that provide an initial channel to join, such as command line
  arguments, the DCOP interface, the bookmark system or irc:// links).
  Previously, the application would have inconsistently either reused an
  existing or created a new connection.
* Better dialog messages in the interactive variant of the decision to either
  reuse or create a new connection (from the Server List dialog and the Quick
  Connect dialog).
* Improved and more consistent display of connection names (i.e. network or
  server host name) throughout the application.
* Much improved irc:// URL support for connection intanciation, with support
  added for IPv6 host names and many of the features proposed by the Mirashi
  specification.
* Eliminated redundant irc:// URL parsing codepaths in favor of a single one.
* Added support for irc:// URLs to the chat views.
* Removed "konversationircprotocolhandler" shell script. The Konversation
  executable now understands irc:// URLs directly.
* Initiating connections from command line arguments and options now works also
  when the application is already running.
* Fixed a bug that would cause a connection initiated from command line options
  not to get past the identity validation stage when the configuration file was
  unitialized and empty.
* The server list dialog will now always be closed when starting Konversation
  with command line arguments to initiate a connection, consistent with the
  configuration-based auto-connect behavior.
* Providing a channel in the creation of a new connection (i.e. via command line
  arguments, the DCOP interface, the Quick Connect dialog, the bookmark system
  or irc:// links) now consistently pre-empts the stored auto-join channel list
  if the target of the connection is a network or the hostname is found to be
  part of a configured network. Previously, this would only work for Quick
  Connect and the bookmark system (which caused the infamous Sabayon user flood
  in #kde due to their "Get Support" desktop link connecting to Freenode, which
  in an unconfigured Konversation has #kde in its auto-join list).
* Connections now have globally unique IDs.
* The DCOP interface now understands connection IDs in addition to host names.
* The scripting systems now uses globally unique connection IDs rather than
  server host names to refer to connections, fixing a bug where scripted
  responses were being handed to all connections sharing a hostname (which was
  actually intentional in the absence of connection IDs, but undesirable for
  users).
* Improved iteration behavior over a network's server list on connection losses.
* The "Reconnect" action now works also when Konversation doesn't consider the
  connection to be in a disconnected state.
* Improved the server status view messages related to reconnection attempts.
* Consistently apply the "Reconnect delay" setting (previously confusingly named
  "Reconnect timeout"), which wasn't done before.
* Fixed a bug that could cause the connection process to claim that a DNS lookup
  was successful when it actually wasn't.
* Fixed opening bookmarks with spaces in the target address name (which may be a
  network name, and networks may have spaces in their name).
* Properly update the state of the "Add/Remove to Watched Nicknames" nickname
  context menu actions when the connection isn't to a config-backed network, in
  which case there's no way to store and make use of those list entries.
* Fixed a crash when quitting the application with a resident connection that
  disconnected due to an SSL error.
* Fixed crashes in the DCOP interface if no connection was present.
* Make the "Reconnect" action available even while ostensibly in the process of
  connecting.
* Fix possible crash when closing all views and subsequently creating a new
  connection.
* Fixed crash upon auto-connect at application startup.
* Improved the naming of preferences related to automatic reconnection attempts
  to be less confusing.
* Made it possible to set the number of automatic reconnection attempts to
  unlimited.
* Provided better default values to the preferences related to automatic
  reconnection attempts.
* Fixed crash when opening a Konsole tab and Konsole was not installed.
* Fixed allowing the user to create an infinite loop of showing the SSL
  connection details dialog upon being presented with the invalid certificate
  multiple choice dialog at connection time by checking "Do not ask again" and
  then clicking "Details".

Identities
* Made it possible to set a Quit message independently from the Part message.
* Saving a newly-created identity is no longer allowed without entering a real
  name.
* Apply switching the identity in the identity dialog as opened from the network
  dialog to the network's settings.
* Have the Edit/Delete/Up/Down buttons for the nickname list of an Identity
  correctly change state according to the selection

Away system
* Added per-identity support for automatic away on a configurable amount of user
  desktop inactivity and/or screensaver activation, along with support for
  automatic return on activity.
* Fixed the "Global Away" toggle to make sense and update its state properly.
* Turned parameter-less '/away' into a toggle: Sets away state with default
  message initially, and unsets away state if already away.
* Added an '/aunaway' command to complement '/aaway' (previously, there was only
  '/aback').
* Broadly rewrote away management related code for improved robustness and less
  duplication and hacks (e.g. no more abuse of multiServerCommand for global
  away).

DCC
* Massive DCC refactoring and improved reliability.
* Passive DCC support (Reverse DCC RECV, SEND).
* Replaced the DCC Transfer Details dialog with a retractable transfer details
  pane directly in the DCC Status tab.
* Added DCC transfer average speed reading to the DCC transfer details panel.
* The DCC Status tab now remembers its column widths across sessions.
* Fixed duplicated quotation marks around file names in DCC transfer status
  messages.
* Fixed "Open File" DCC dialog remembering the last viewed location incorrectly.
* Added an "Open Folder" button to the DCC transfer details panel.
* Added check for whether the URL is well-formed before initiating a DCC send.
  Fixes a bug of dragging a nickname link in the chat view onto the query chat
  view drop target starting a DCC transfer that cannot succeed.
* Ported the DCC code away from relying on server group IDs to refer to
  connections, made it use connection IDs instead. Fixes potential bugs with
  multiple concurrent connections to the same network.
* Fixed queued DCC transfer items not picking up on download destination
  directory changes.
* Fixed bug leading to crash upon initiating DCC Chat when "Focus new tabs" was
  enabled.
* [New since RC1] New transfer items added to the DCC panel's transfer list are no
  longer automatically selected, meaning work on other items in the list occuring
  at the same time no longer gets interrupted.
* [New since RC1] The "Filename:" line in the DCC panel's detailed info pane is
  now using text squeezing to avoid an increase in minimum window width with long
  file names.
* [New since RC1] Failed receives now longer show 833TB/s as their transfer
  speed.

Blowfish support
* Fixed FiSH-style +p prefix to send clear text to channel despite an encryption
  key being set.
* Text encoding is now being applied to the cleartext, rather than the
  ciphertext. This fixes using characters outside the ASCII range with blowfish
  encryption.
* Fixed CTCP (and thus DCC) requests to nicknames for whom an encryption key is
  set.
* Added support for encrypted topics.
* If an encryption key is set, a lock icon will now be shown next to the input
  box.
* Added a '/showkey <channel|query>' command to show the encryption key for the
  target in a popup dialog.

Auto-replace
* Improved auto-replace behavior with multiple matches in one line (fixes
  multiple Wikipedia links).
* Fixed bug that could cause auto-replace to replace the wrong group of the
  matching string.
* Auto-replace is now case-sensitive in regular expression mode.
* Added regular expression editor button to auto-replace preferences.
* Fixed conditional enabling of the RegExpEditor button in the auto-replace
  preferences page.

Ignore
* Fixed being asked twice whether to close a query upon ignoring the opponent.
* Fixed crash when opting to close a query upon chosing to ignore the opponent
  from the context menu of his nickname.

Watched Nicknames
* Improved robustness of the Watched Nicknames Online system.
* The "Offline" branches in the "Watched Nicks Online" list will now be omitted
  when there are no offline nicks for the respective network.
* Fixed display of WHOIS spam prompted by the Watch List's WHOIS activity.
* Connections to non-config-backed targets no longer show in Watched Nicks
  Online.
* [New since RC1] Actually honor the preference to enable/disable the Watched
  Nicknames Online system, and apply it at runtime.
* [New since RC1] Make sure the periodic Watched Nicknames Online check actually
  starts running within the same session after adding the first nickname to the
  list.
* [New since RC1] Fixed a crash on quit with the Watched Nicks Online tab open and
  there being an open connection to a network that nicks are being watched for.

Channel List
* IRC markup is now removed from content in the Channel List view.
* Speed improvements in Channel List views.
* Fixed keyboard accelerator collisions in Channel List views.
* Allow higher values than 99 in the min/max users filter spin boxes in Channel
  List views.

Under the Hood / Protocol
* Rewrote the outbound queue scheduling system to be smart enough to reorder
  outbound traffic to reduce interactive latency while aggressively throttling
  the rate to prevent flooding. Use '/queuetuner' to tweak.
* Rearranged when and how auto-who is triggered upon channel join a bit, to
  avoid excessive flooding on multiple concurrent joins in some cases.
* Auto-Who reliability improvements.
* Fixed auto-join with very many channels (the auto-join command would exceed
  the maximum buffer length; it is now split into multiple commands as needed).
* Fixed bugs around rejoining channels after reconnects related to the cause of
  the disconnect, channel passwords and picking the actual list of joined
  channels over the network's auto-join list.
* Improved behavioral consistency in situations where the auto-join list is
  preempted by a transitory auto-join channel (bookmarks, etc.).
* Fixed bug that caused the topic state not to be cleared properly prior to
  rejoining channels during reconnects.
* Fixed onotice payload being cut off after the first word.
* Changed RPL_WHOISOPERATOR handling to internationalize the common case ("is an
  IRC Operator") and otherwise passthrough the string sent by the server.
* Fixed parsing of alternate invite format on Asuka ircds (QuakeNet).
* Added support for PRIVMSG from the server.
* Support RPL_UMODEIS.
* Announce 'k' channel mode (i.e. channel key) changes in non-raw mode as well.
* The command part of CTCP requests is now always converted to uppercase before
  sending, as some clients don't like lower- or mixed-case commands as the user
  may have entered them.
* Display mode for your nick and channels you're not in.
* Fixed per-channel encoding settings for the channels of a network being lost
  when the network is renamed.
* Fixed crash when receiving actions for channels the client is not attending.
* Made newline handling in the DCOP interface more robust, fixing a potential
  security problem (CVE-2007-4400).
* A few speed optimizations and memory leak fixes.
* [New since RC1] Fixed a crash on quit during KDE logout or when quitting by
  DCOP.

Included scripts
* Support for KMPlayer in the 'media' script (based on the window caption, as
  KMPlayer has no proper appropriate DCOP interface).
* Added KPlayer support to the 'media' script (also caption-based).
* Added support for Audacious to the 'media' script.
* Fixed problems in disk space calculation in the 'sysinfo' script caused by
  wrapped df(1) output.

* [New since RC1] Fixed a bug in the 'media' script that caused it to break when
  querying Audacious with audtool not being available.

* [New since RC1] Standards compliancy fixes in the application .desktop file and
  the nicklist icon theme .desktop files.

Build
* Fixed build with --enable-final.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes from 1.0 to 1.0.1
We are pleased to announce the immediate availability of Konversation 1.0.1,
a maintenance release featuring notable improvements for users of right-to-
left languages (including new Arabic and Hebrew translations), further re-
finement of the user interface and application functionality, and fixes for
minor defects found in the previous release.

* A bug that caused left-to-right text contained in lines determined to be
  right-to-left text to appear reversed has been fixed.
* Whether a line is treated as right-to-left vs. left-to-right text is now
  determined by the amount of each type of character in the line, improving
  the user experience in chats involving bi-directional text considerably.
* The "Edit Network" dialog has been refined for clarity and ease of use.
* A warning dialog to prevent accidentally quitting Konversation has been
  added.
* The Auto Replace list can now be sorted.
* The '/media' script command now sports improved player recognition, enhan-
  ced and easier configurability, the ability to distinguish between audio
  and video media as well as newly added support for kdetv. New '/audio' and
  '/video' command aliases have been added to expose these new abilities.
* The lower boundary of the default DCC port range has been raised from 1025
  to 1026 to avoid conflicts with the commonly blocked Windows RPC port 1025.
* Dismissing an OSD notification by clicking on it will now also cancel the
  systray notification flash.
* A new configuration file option [OSD]OSDCheckDesktopLock has been added,
  allowing to manually disable the screensaver check in non-KDE environments
  that do not support it, causing the OSD not to be displayed.
* A bug that could lead to the "Switch to" sub-menu in the context menus of
  tabs not to be updated properly upon switching tabs has been fixed.
* A bug that caused the 'irc setBack' DCOP call not to function has been
  fixed.
* A bug that caused ampersands in the names of tabs not to be displayed and
  an immediately following character to be used as keyboard accelerator has
  been fixed.
* A bug that caused ignoring nicknames with '[' or ']' characters in them to
  fail has been fixed.
* Command aliases containing regular expression syntax can no longer cause
  built-in commands not to function.
* A bug that caused the Konversation irc:// protocol handler not to function
  has been fixed. Its compatibility with systems that do not use the GNU bash
  shell as default shell has been improved.
* A notable number of code quality improvements suggested by KDEs automated
  quality control service EBN have been implemented.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes from 0.19 to 1.0
We are extremely pleased to announce the immediate availability of Konversation
1.0, a significant milestone in the lifetime of the Konversation project. This
release includes major new functionality as well as a large amount of
improvements to existing functionality, with an emphasis on user interface
polish and overall reliability. Notable new features include a vertical treelist
of tabs as an alternative to the traditional tab bar, auto-replacement of words
in incoming and outgoing messages, an improved Channel Settings dialog now
featuring a ban list, an optional expanding input box and many improvements to
both DCC file transfers and DCC chats. Enjoy!


User Interface
* It is now possible to place the tabs on the left side of the application
window.
  This has been implemented as a treelist of tabs. The treelist supports all of
  the cosmetic and interactive properties of the original horizontal tab bar,
  including colored notifications, LED icons, (hover) close buttons with delayed
  activation, reordering, drag'n'drop and mouse wheel cruising. And a few tricks
  of its own.
* Connection status tabs now feature specific context menu entries to disconnect
  and reconnect, as well as to join a channel on that connection.
* The automatic resizing of tabs in the tab bar first implemented in version
  0.19 is now optional.
* The grouping behavior of Channel List and Raw Log tabs in the tab bar has been
  improved.
* Disabling notification for a tab will now unset the active notification.
* The enabled/disabled state of the notifications for connection status tabs
will
  now be remembered across sessions for configured networks.
* The speed of switching tabs in quick succession with the auto-spellchecking
  preference enabled has been improved.
* Using custom fonts in the user interface is now optional. The font used by the
  tab bar is now configurable.
* Events in the connection status tabs are now logged into separate logfiles.
* The Channel Settings dialog now includes a Ban List tab that allows viewing,
  adding and removing bans in a channel. The dialog can now be opened from the
  menu bar and chat window context menu in addition to the button in the topic
  area.
* Mode and topic handling in the Channel Settings dialog and the channel mode
  buttons have been overhauled to make them more robust and reliable.
* The number of Quick Buttons to show below the nickname list in channel tabs is
  now configurable. Additional buttons may be added or existing buttons removed.
* Konversation now supports auto-replacing words in incoming and outgoing
  messages. Regular expressions are supported. The auto-replace configuration
can
  be found in the preferences dialog. The static Wiki link feature found in
older
  versions has been retired in favor of an auto-replace rule.
* The search bar has been redesigned to provide a better user experience.
* The "Find Next" action will now open the search bar when there is no active
  search, matching the behavior of Konqueror and other KDE applications.
* The sorting of the nick completion list has been improved to put the last
  active user for a given completion prefix at the beginning of the list.
* The tab completion of the user's own nickname has been reenabled.
* The nick completion feature has been significantly cleaned up and made more
  reliable. A bug that could lead to an application crash during nick completion
  has been fixed.
* An option to expand the vertical size of the input box automatically when the
  text entered grows beyond the length of a single line has been added.
* The behavior of the input box on pasting text including leading or trailing
  newline characters has been improved never to cause lines being sent without
  user acknowledgement.
* The input box of connection status, channel and query tabs will now be
disabled
  and the nickname list of channel tabs cleared when the respective server
  connection is closed.
* Konversation can now optionally insert a remember line whenever a tab is
hidden,
  either by switching to a different tab or minimizing the window.
* Multiple consecutive remember lines will no longer be inserted.
* Remember lines can now also be inserted into the chat windows of connection
  status and DCC Chat tabs.
* The Colored Nicknames feature will now always assign the same color to the

* The Server List dialog now allows connecting to a specific server in a network
  even when a connection to that network has been previously established. If

fixed.

Technology

the
  text payload. Encodings that use multiple or variable numbers of bytes per

  the configured network that the quick connect server was recognized as being a

  network when choosing to connect to a specific server from the Server List
dialog
  has been fixed.
* A dialog will now ask the user for an additional nickname when all nicknames
  configured in the identity where tried unsuccessfully during a connection
  attempt. This replaces the previous behavior of repeatedly appending
underscores
  to the last nickname, which eventually ran into the nickname length limit on
the
  server.
* A bug that could lead to unnecessary nick changes immediately after connecting
  to a server has been fixed.
* A bug that could lead to Konversation trying to auto-identify multiple times
  upon connect on certain servers has been fixed.

Changes from 0.18 to 0.19
We are extremely pleased to announce the immediate release of Konversation 0.19.
The focus
of this release is on extending and improving upon established functionality.
Most notable
in this regard are significantly improved management of IRC networks and servers
all across
the application, a redesigned tab bar and better support for common IRC
commands. A long
list of further additions and improvements has us confident of this being the
best version
of Konversation yet. Enjoy!


User Interface
* The Server List dialog has been rewritten to allow direct manipulation of a
network's
  servers and features more intelligent sorting behavior. Reordering networks
via drag
  and drop is now possible. A behavioral audit of all actions in the dialog

notifications
  as well as more intelligent scaling behavior under space-critical conditions.

tab.

and
  clarity.
* The KDE standard text font will now be correctly set as initial default chat
font.
* It is now possible to skip displaying a server's MOTD on connect.

  previously configured default chat font is already a fixed-width font, the
chat font
  will now be used rather than the global KDE default fixed-width font.
