Here are some scripts that can help you in everyday life with konvi.

They are usually put in ~/.kde/share/apps/konversation/scripts/ and executed by
typing /exec <scriptname> in konversation.

Since scripts are executed by system, they should have 'executable' flag on.
This is most easily achieved by running chmod +x <scriptname>
